    <h5 class="taskme">OUR PARTNERS</h5>
    <div class="task">
        <p>We believe in making good bread. As we've grown,
            so has our menu and<br>our community, yet our
            values have stayed the same.We take the 
            time to<br>make our bread, pastries, cakes, 
            breakfasts and lunches as we always<br> have - 
            with care, by hand and according to the season - 
            so that we don't<br> need to compromise on what we eat,
            whether we're on the go, or taking<br> time out in one of our bakeries.</p><br>
        <p>Everyone is welcome in our bakeries. We
            believe in the power of community,<br> in 
            helping those around us and living as 
            sustainably as possible.<br> We insist on the
            finest ingredients, supporting small businesses
            wherever<br> we can, and though we're always
            innovating, our baking is based on<br> time-honoured
            techniques and our decades-old starters. Nothing 
            gives us<br> as much pleasure as a freshly baked, lovingly crafted loaf.</p><br>
        <p>We bake by hand with natural ingredients, and whilst 
            we are ordinary<br> people, we want to make extraordinary
            things. We want to play our part<br> to bring humanity back into the food
            world, back to local communities.<br> We can't imagine doing anything more
            gratifying than baking our,<br> and your, bread.</p>

    <div class="cummings">OUR HISTORY</div>
    <div class="task">
        <p>In the 1990s, Gail Mejia brought the best bakers in town together
           to bake<br> for London's top chefs and restaurants. Our wholesale business,<br>
           The Bread Factory, which was named ironically because it has always 
           exclusively<br> specialised in handmade, traditional artisan baking, 
           continues to thrive,<br> serving top restaurants and discerning customers.</p><br>
        <p>Our first GAIL's bakery opened in London's Hampstead High Street 
            in<br> 2005. Today, we have 74 bakeries in neighbourhoods in and 
            around<br> London, Oxford, Brighton and beyond.</p><br>
            <p>We hope you'll join us soon.</p>
